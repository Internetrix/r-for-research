# skimr  



skimr provides a frictionless approach to summary statistics which conforms to the principle of least surprise, displaying summary statistics the user can skim quickly to understand their data.  

Install the latest development version:   

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/skimr")
```

# The tidyverse  

The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.   

https://www.tidyverse.org/  

Install from CRAN   

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages('tidyverse')
``` 

Ideally suited for:  

+ Reading in data  
+ Manipulating and tidying data  
+ Visualisation of results

# tidyverse demo  

This example shows some more advanced use of data manipulation and visualisation. 

From the  [Tidy Tuesday Project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

### Space launches
These are the data behind the "space launches" article, The space race is dominated by new contenders. Principal data came from the Jonathan McDowell's JSR Launch Vehicle Database, available online at http://www.planet4589.org/space/lvdb/index.html.


*Example adapted from from https://github.com/dgrtwo/data-screencasts/blob/master/space-launches.Rmd*  

---

# Reading in data  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

launches <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-01-15/launches.csv")

head(launches)
```

---

# Pre-processing  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
launches_processed <- launches %>%
  filter(launch_date <= Sys.Date()) %>%
  filter(state_code == "US") %>%
  add_count(type) %>%
  filter(n >= 20) %>%
  mutate(type = fct_reorder(type, launch_date, min),
         agency_type = str_to_title(agency_type))
```

+ Use of the pipe `%>%` operator improved readability with collaborators  
+ Ability to filter, aggregate, select columns, reorder, text manipulation  
+ Supports Non-Standard Evaluation (NSE)

# Working with others 

Version control and collaboration

---

# Git  / Github  

+ Powerful version control system used in software development  

+ Also well suited to managing research work  

+ Controls the 'source code' of your work with multiple contributors

# Use cases for git in science  

1. Lab notebook  
2. Facilitating Collaboration  
3. Backup and Failsafe against data loss  
4. Freedom to explore new ideas and methods  
5. Mechanism to solicit feedback and reviews  
6. Increase transparency and verifiability  
7. Managing large data
8. Lowering barriers to reuse

# R Packages  

> In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others

source: [R Packages - Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html)

### Why R Packages?  

+ Amplify your research work by turning it into open-source software  
+ Publish and licence your software to the community  
+ Ensure it can be run and maintained by others and not trapped on the 'C Drive'  

[ROpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) has a great model for promoting open data and
software for science.
